# Weird Kotlin Compiler Error

This is not at all a useful discovery, the code below generates an obscure
compiler error. It is a visibility violation. Normally, the violation would be
reported as `Cannot access '<init>': it is protected in 'Example'`. But because
this is hidden behind a condition, it shows some bogus error.

> Try it [here][playground]!

```kotlin
// the "protected" keyword caused the error
class Example protected constructor()

// this also works no matter it is "if (true)" or "if (false)"
fun getConstructor() = if (true) ::Example else null

// it doesn't matter whether it is called or not
fun main() {
}
```
