# Website Optimization

All of the website's raster images have been cropped and converted into WebP.
Although there will be slight artifacting in the images, the load time has
already been halved and some of the images have
one-fifteenth of its original size.

It is planned to have this site's LCP time and CLS score reduce further
in the future.

P.S. The URL is not permanent and will be invalid in the future.
