# Docker on WSL with SSH

Here is a [write-up][writeup] for setting up Docker and SSH painlessly on a
Windows system. It details the installation steps, the setup of the firewall,
and the potential pitfalls one may encounter during the process.

Even if you are an expert in setting up such system in the Unix realm, this
write-up can provide insight on the security enforcement methods in Windows.
Hope you enjoy it.
