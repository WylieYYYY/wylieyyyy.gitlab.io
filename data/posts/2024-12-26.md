# Frustrating Node Connection Timeout

A late Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year for everyone,
this is a slight rant about trying to update this site.

Some time ago, I tried to update the dependencies for this site. Met a road-
block when the new version timed out when requesting a GitLab API endpoint.
Thought it was a problem on my side, or on GitLab's side, but no resolution.

Today, I checked out the trace from the connection error, and find that it has
two connections that both failed, of which one have a ridiculously short time-
out.

Many thanks to the recent finding from [r1ch's blog][r1ch], this site can
finally be updated. It was due to a broken IPv6 fallback implementation of
the "Happy Eyeballs" standard.

Details can be found here: [GitHub issue][github issue].

I have added the `--no-network-family-autoselection` argument for now as a
workaround, which works correctly and I am glad to have this out of the way.
